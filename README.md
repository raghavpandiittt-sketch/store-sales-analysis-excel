# Store Sales Analysis – Excel Project

## Overview
This is my first end-to-end data analysis project created using Microsoft Excel.  
The goal of this project was to analyze one full year of store sales data and understand sales trends, customer behavior, and platform performance.

## Objective
- Analyze yearly sales data to identify high and low sales periods  
- Understand which platforms generate the most revenue  
- Identify top customers and overall sales contribution  

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts and Visualizations  
- Basic Data Cleaning  

## Dataset
- One year of store sales data  
- Contains order dates, sales amount, customer details, order status, and sales channels  

## Analysis Performed
- Monthly sales trend analysis to identify peak and low sales months  
- Platform-wise sales analysis (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)  
- Customer-wise analysis to identify top buyers  
- Order status analysis (Delivered, Returned, Cancelled)  

## Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard was created using pivot tables and slicers to allow easy filtering and analysis of sales data.

## Key Insights
- Sales are higher during specific months of the year  
- A single platform contributes the majority of total sales  
- A small group of customers accounts for a significant portion of revenue
